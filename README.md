#Aced Cake Gaming
==============

§0.0  - Introduction 
--------------------------------------------
This repo is for planning an Ace-themed web-based game. Upon AVENite Mobocracy's suggestion, I will post some publicly editable-lists. These will be for keeping track of who is contributing to the project and what roles they are fulfilling.

♠ The original AVEN thread: http://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/110231-asexuality-themed-video-game/

Please post to the thread and/or email the project organizer (saturnalia@bitmessage.ch) if you are interested in contributing!!

§1.0  - Contributors
--------------------------------------------
We haven't decided what tools to use for building the game, and the roles might need to be defined to greater level of granularity. A lot of these issues will be decided once we have an initial team. Contributors will have the ability to modify this repository; this includes being able to upload additional documents, code, art, etc.

We could probably use multiple people for each position, so don't be afraid to apply if you see one or more people already occupying one.

Contributors (by role):
* 1.1. Business -
* 1.2. Game Design - Mobocracy (isn2479@rit.edu), zippadoodle (zippadoodle@gmail.com), ...
* 1.3. Graphics - zippadoodle (zippadoodle@gmail.com),...
* 1.4. Programming - DiEvAl (z-diomidov@yandex.ru), ...
* 1.5. Project Organization - OstrichEgg (saturnalia@bitmessage.ch), ...
* 1.6. Sound & Music -
* 1.7. Testing - Sutoriku (sunshinepotter@ymail.com)
  
Role Descriptions:
* 1.8. Business - Promotion, hosting, distribution, tracking expenses/profits (if any)
* 1.9. Game Design - Planning the flow of the game, putting the art, sound, and mechanics together into a cohesive whole. Story creation might be an ancillary role or a separate role, depending on what is needed.
* 1.10. Graphics - This might be further subdivided into sprite creation vs. backgrounds/foregrounds/etc.
* 1.11. Programming - The framework will probably be javacript/html5 based (e.g. Phaser or EaselJS)
* 1.12. Project Organization - Communicating with all contributors, forming and maintaining consensus on project direction, ensuring goals are met.
* 1.13. Sound & Music - Sound effects and music. If you are a musician, this can be a great way to promote your work.
* 1.14. Testing - Requires having good taste in video games, being able to criticize lameness (e.g. point out aspects of the game that are unoriginal or detract from the fun), finding bugs/flaws, and suggesting improvements.
