This repo is for planning an Ace-themed web-based game. Upon AVENite Mobocracy's suggestion, I will post some publicly editable-lists. These will be for keeping track of who is contributing to the project and what roles they will play.

♠ The original AVEN thread: http://www.asexuality.org/en/topic/110231-asexuality-themed-video-game/

Please post to the thread if you are interested in contributing!!

§1.0  - Contributors
--------------------------------------------
We haven't decided what tools to use for building the game, and the roles might need to be defined to greater level of granularity. A lot of these issues will be decided once we have an initial team. Contributors will have the ability to modify this repository; this includes being able to upload additional documents, code, art, etc.
